 ## Description
 
 I made this project to demonstrate my knowledge of mySQL and Node.js
 
 This application helps employers keep track of employees in different departments. 
 I learned that console.table(result) makes a fancy table in node.js and that
 the tables look great!
 I watched the class videos and I had a tutoring session, getting the schema to work with the seeds.sql and the index.js was all very tricky. 
 Someday I would love to add a front end! 

## Installation
To install this project you will need SQL and Node.js.
